# Privacy Policy for CodeTranslateAI

**Last Updated:** July 23, 2025

Thank you for using CodeTranslateAI. This privacy policy explains how our extension handles data. The source code for this extension is publicly available on **[GitHub](https://github.com/dineshsutihar/CodeTranslateAI)**.

## Data Collection and Usage

CodeTranslateAI is designed with your privacy in mind.

1.  **Website Content (Code Snippets):** The core function of this extension is to translate code. When you select a piece of code on a webpage and activate the translation, that selected text is sent to our secure backend, which then forwards it to the Google Gemini API to perform the translation.

2.  **No Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), such as your name, email, IP address, or Browse history.

3.  **Data Anonymity:** The code snippets sent for translation are not associated with you or your account in any way.

## Data Storage

Translated code snippets are cached locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local` to improve performance and avoid repeat API calls. This data is stored only in your browser and is not accessible to us. The cache is designed to automatically clear items after 10 days.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties. The only data transfer occurs for the explicit purpose of providing the translation service via the Google Gemini API.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please **[open an issue on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dineshsutihar/CodeTranslateAI/issues)**.
